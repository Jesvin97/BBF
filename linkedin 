That is a very important insight. If you prefer the Business side of things (Strategy, Management, Consulting), moving these simulations to the Projects section is actually better for you.
Why? Because "Governance" and "Security Awareness" are business-facing functions. By framing them as specific projects, you show you understand how to execute a task, not just hold a job title.
Here is the exact content to copy and paste into your Projects section. I have rewritten them to highlight Business Impact, Risk Management, and Communication—skills that bridge the gap between Tech and Business.

A Quick Tip for Your "Business" Focus:
Since you said you like the business side more, you should aim for roles like GRC Analyst (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), Cybersecurity Consultant, or Pre-Sales Engineer.
These roles require you to know the tech (which you do) but talk the business language (which you like).
Would you like me to rewrite your "About" section to position you as a "Cybersecurity Strategist" rather than just a technical pentester?
